<p><b>After graduating from Humber College, Osasere Obazogbon, Katelynn Caceres, and Joseph Waldron, three passionate computer programming students, embarked on a delicious journey together. Fueled by their shared love for food and a desire to make a positive impact, they founded BigFin with a vision to create a fun and vibrant environment while serving ethically sourced cuisine. Harnessing their technical skills, they even designed and developed the website for the restaurant, showcasing their dedication to every aspect of the venture. Their combined expertise in both technology and culinary arts has allowed them to craft a dining experience that not only delights the taste buds but also upholds values of sustainability and ethical sourcing. With their innovative spirit and commitment to excellence, they've transformed their dream into a reality, inviting guests to indulge in flavorful dishes while supporting a cause they believe in.</b></p>
